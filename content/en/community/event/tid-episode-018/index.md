Join us on December 9th for the next Istio weekly episode, where we'll show you how to install Istio with an external control plane.

The external control plane deployment model offers a clean separation between mesh operators and mesh administrators.  Mesh operators install and manage Istioâ€™s control plane on one cluster and then connect one or more remote clusters (data planes) to form a mesh. Mesh administrators can then configure the mesh as needed.
